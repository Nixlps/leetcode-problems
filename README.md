## A repository for saving my solutions to Leetcode problems :relaxed:

- Every problem has it's own folder with a .txt explaning the problem and a code file containing the solution

- I'll be using the same nomenclature used by Leetcode: #problem-number_problem-title

- If more than one solution is made, it will be written in another file

- I'm using one of those languages: JavaScript, Python or Go
